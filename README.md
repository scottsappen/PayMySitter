# PayMySitter
A skeleton project of the real PayMySitter Python web application running in Google Cloud Platform with Stripe payments integration.

While I cannot put the entire codebase here (with secret API keys and such), this will be instructive if you are:
- learning how to put Python web apps up on GCP
- working with Managed Accounts in Stripe (purely an API implementation)
- working with a combination of SQL and NoSQL datastores
